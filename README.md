# Data Analysis
- It is a process to clean, inspect and understand data by applying different mathematical techniques so that a good appropriate decision can be made using that data.
</br>
- The Data Analysis step include mainly these steps:
                       1. Define your question and obejctive.
                       2. Collect appropriate data.
                       3. Clean and transform data to a format which is good enough to do analysis and perform data modeling.
                       4. Analyze data.
                       5. Interpret results in a way that is easy to understand like giving good facts and numbers or providing different visualization in form of different graphs and charts.

## Data Wrangling                       
- [Data Wrangling](https://github.com/divyanshchoubisa/DATA-ANALYSIS/blob/master/data-wrangling.ipynb) is a process of cleaning and structuring the complex available data to a format which would be easy to analyse.</br>
- It mainly includes:
            1. Data Cleaning
                 1.1 - Handling missing values.
                 1.2 - Remove Duplicates.
                 1.3 - Making data readable e.g Replacing all "New York" values in all rows with "NY" or vice versa based on problem you are solving.</br>
                 - There are many more different problem encountered while doing data cleaning.</br>
            2. Data Transformation
                 2.1 - It is the process of converting data from one format or structure into another format or structure.</br> 
            3. Data enrichment
                3.1 - Using available data to create/derive new data.
                      3.1.1 - You can make new columns by perfoming appropriate mathematical operations.
                      3.2.2 - Perform Binning.
                      3.3.3 - Summarizing the data.
                      3.4.4 - Data Resampling.
