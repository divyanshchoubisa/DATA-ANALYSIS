# Data Analysis
It is a process to clean, inspect and understand data by applying different mathematical techniques so that a good appropriate decision can be made using that data.
</br>
- The Data Analysis step include mainly these steps:
  1. Define your question and obejctive.
  2. Collect appropriate data.
  3. Clean and transform data to a format which is good enough to do analysis and perform data modeling.
  4. Analyze data.
  5. Interpret results in a way that is easy to understand like giving good facts and numbers or providing different visualization in form of different graphs and charts.

## Data Wrangling                       
-[Data Wrangling](https://github.com/divyanshchoubisa/DATA-ANALYSIS/blob/master/data-wrangling.ipynb/) is a process of cleaning and structuring the complex available data to a format which would be easy to analyse.</br>
- It mainly includes:
  - Data Cleaning
    * Handling missing values.
    * Remove Duplicates.
    * Making data readable e.g Replacing all "New York" values in all rows with "NY" or vice versa based on problem you are solving.</br>
    * There are many more different problem encountered while doing data cleaning.
  - Data Transformation
    * It is the process of converting data from one format or structure into another format or structure.
  - Data enrichment
    * Using available data to create/derive new data.
    * You can make new columns by perfoming appropriate mathematical operations.
    * Perform Binning.
    * Summarizing the data.
    * Data Resampling.
