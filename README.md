# Data Analysis
It is a process to clean, inspect and understand data by applying different mathematical techniques so that a good appropriate decision can be made using that data.
</br>
- The Data Analysis step include mainly these steps:</br>
                       1. Define your question and obejctive.</br>
                       2. Collect appropriate data.</br>
                       3. Clean and transform data to a format which is good enough to do analysis and perform data modeling.</br>
                       4. Analyze data.</br>
                       5. Interpret results in a way that is easy to understand like giving good facts and numbers or providing different visualization in form of different graphs and charts.</br>

## Data Wrangling                       
-[Data Wrangling](https://github.com/divyanshchoubisa/DATA-ANALYSIS/blob/master/data-wrangling.ipynb/) is a process of cleaning and structuring the complex available data to a format which would be easy to analyse.</br>
- It mainly includes:
            1. Data Cleaning
              * Handling missing values.
              * Remove Duplicates.
              * Making data readable e.g Replacing all "New York" values in all rows with "NY" or vice versa based on problem you are solving.</br>
              * There are many more different problem encountered while doing data cleaning.
            2. Data Transformation
              * It is the process of converting data from one format or structure into another format or structure.
            3. Data enrichment
              * Using available data to create/derive new data.
              * You can make new columns by perfoming appropriate mathematical operations.
              * Perform Binning.
              * Summarizing the data.
              * Data Resampling.
